# Review instructions for App Store

Books can be browsed without login, but loaning and reservation require strong
authentication via Suomi.fi (Finnish bank credentials, certification card or
mobile certificate).

Registering a passkey is only possible after the initial Suomi.fi login (by
going to the app's settings and pressing "Register a passkey").

For review purposes, the app has a "test login" page,
which can be accessed only through a deep link.

Please follow these instructions to review the app:    
1. Make sure the app is closed (not running in the background)
2. Open the Safari browser and go to:
    - https://tunnistus.e-kirjasto.fi/test-login
3. Choose "Open in the E-kirjasto app"
4. On the test login page that opens, use the credentials supplied to reviewers
5. Close the onboarding/intro by clicking the button in the top-right corner
6. Choose "Log in with Suomi.fi" and then scroll down to the "Test IdP" option
7. Press "Käytä oletusta 210281-9988" above the "Henkilötunnus" input field
8. Press the "Tunnistaudu" button
9. Press the "Continue to service" button

After the above steps, you are logged in like regular users.
