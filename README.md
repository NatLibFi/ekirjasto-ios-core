# E-kirjasto iOS core

[![ios-main](https://github.com/NatLibFi/ekirjasto-ios-core/actions/workflows/ios-main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/NatLibFi/ekirjasto-ios-core/actions/workflows/ios-main.yml)

The National Library of Finland's fork of the Palace Project iOS client,
which is itself the Lyrasis fork of the NYPL's Library Simplified iOS client.


## System requirements

- Install Xcode 15.4 in `/Applications`, open it and make sure to install additional components if it asks you.
- Install [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) if you haven't already.
    - Using Homebrew is recommended, so run `brew install carthage`.


## Building

```bash
git clone git@github.com:NatLibFi/ekirjasto-ios-core.git
cd ekirjasto-ios-core

# Idempotent bootstrap script, can be run again to rebuild dependencies
./scripts/bootstrap.sh
```

The above bootstrap script also reveals secrets for production builds.
For more info, see `./scripts/reveal-secrets.sh --help`.

Open `Palace.xcodeproj` in Xcode and build the `Ekirjasto` target.

Alternatively, you can build the app by running `./scripts/build.sh`
(use `--help` to see build options).

At this point you may have seemingly random build errors especially if you are
not using an Intel chip (M1/M2/M3/etc.) but running this script might help:

```bash
# Requires sudo, because it also cleans ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/
./scripts/clean.sh
```

If you get `Missing package product '...'` errors,
closing and reopening the Xcode project should help.


### Build configurations

The app uses build configurations to switch the backend.
The configurations are of the form `<BuildType>-<configuration>`,
so for example `Debug-dev` is a debug build using the `dev` configuration/backend.

The available configurations are:

| Configuration      | Build type | Backend    |
|--------------------|------------|------------|
| Debug              | debug      | production |
| Debug-ellibs       | debug      | ellibs     |
| Debug-dev          | debug      | dev        |
| Debug-beta         | debug      | beta       |
| Debug-production   | debug      | production |
| Release            | release    | production |
| Release-ellibs     | release    | ellibs     |
| Release-dev        | release    | dev        |
| Release-beta       | release    | beta       |
| Release-production | release    | production |

The `Debug` and `Debug-production` are essentially identical,
and they both use the `production` backend.
The same is true for `Release` and `Release-production`.

The `Debug` and `Release` configurations are there only for "compatibility",
because some tools (like Carthage) appear to not work nicely if they don't exist,
but you shouldn't need to *use* them (just don't delete them).

To choose the build configuration to use in Xcode,
`Alt-click` the "Run" button and choose which one to use for running, profiling, etc.


## Branching

`main` is the main development branch, and is only updated through pull requests.

Release branch names follow the convention: `release/<version>` (e.g. `release/1.2.3`).


## Continuous integration (CI)

The repository uses continuous integration to aid development and to automate releases.

See [.github/workflows/README.md] for more information about the CI workflows.


## Releasing

Please see [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) for documentation on E-kirjasto's release process.
